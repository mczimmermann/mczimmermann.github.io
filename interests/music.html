                        <td>A scale is a sequence of notes in a specific order (e.g., major or minor), while a chord is a group of notes played together, usually built from notes within a scale.</td>

                        <td>How do producers create electronic sounds?</td>
                        <td>Producers use synthesizers, samplers, and effects plugins to design and manipulate sounds. Techniques include sound synthesis, layering, automation, and processing with effects like reverb, delay, and distortion.</td>
